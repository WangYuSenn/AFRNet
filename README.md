# Training & Testing
modify the train_root train_root save_path path in config.py according to your own data path.

Train the AFRNet:

python train.py

modify the test_path path in test.py according to your own data path.

Test the AFRNet:

python test.py

# Evaluate tools

Implemented through evaluate.py, specific predictions can be obtained by setting the path inside.
